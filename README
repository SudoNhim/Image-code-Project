Currently this repo contains the source code for pyImageServer,
an imageboard where users can generate new images by completing
a Python function stub.

Due to limitations of the current method of processing images,
future versions of this server will instead use client-side
scripting (JS) for image generation. Apart from using Bottle
for handling requests and CherryPy for the server, pretty much
everything will be overhauled.

Currently the server is (usually) up at:
metahub-remote.no-ip.info
